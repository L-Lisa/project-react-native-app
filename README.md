# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
The assignment was to create a simple app in React native with Expo.

## The problem
There were some problems gettign started, but I did a deep dive into the documentation and came out with a solution. That felt wonderful, unfortunately time was up way to fast. I can see the opportunities with React Native and hope that I will be back to learn more soon.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
